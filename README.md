## Hi there, welcome!

I'm a Computer Science student driven by a deep, insatiable curiosity and a passion for solving complex problems. I thrive on breaking down abstractions to truly understand how things work, constantly building practical projects and refining my skills through continuous improvement. 

In my spare time, I study philosophy, mathematics, history, and literature as a hobby, constantly seeking to expand my understanding of the world and grow through diverse perspectives.
